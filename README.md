# Pando Populus  
### Community Resilience & Environmental Intelligence Platform

Pando Populus is a web-based environmental and social resilience project that translates complex climate, infrastructure, and demographic data into clear, community-ready insights. The platform is designed to support understanding, planning, and decision-making around climate risk at the neighborhood scale.

## 🌍 Project Overview

Pando Populus focuses on place-based resilience analysis, integrating environmental hazards with social context to highlight risks, strengths, and multi-benefit solutions. The project emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and practical application of data for communities, students, and planners.

Key focus areas include:
- Heat exposure and urban heat island effects
- Air quality and public health impacts
- Flooding and sea level rise risk
- Wildfire hazard and resilience capacity
- Social vulnerability and accessibility

---

## 📍 Study Area

The primary case study for Pando Populus is **Census Tract 1397.02 in Los Angeles County**, a coastal community characterized by:

- Population of approximately 6,400 residents  
- High homeownership and residential stability  
- Significant elderly population (24% age 65+)  
- Surrounding open space and protected land  

This tract provides a strong example of how environmental risks intersect with aging populations and land use constraints.

## 🧠 What the Website Shows

The website presents:
- A clear overview of the project and its goals
- Summaries of key environmental risks (heat, air quality, flood, wildfire)
- Social and community context that shapes vulnerability
- Nature-based and multi-benefit resilience strategies
- A transparent explanation of data sources and methods
- A plain-language explanation of why the analysis matters

The site is intentionally simple, readable, and mobile-friendly.

## 📊 Data & Methods

The project synthesizes publicly available datasets, including:
- U.S. Census demographic data
- Environmental indicators (heat, canopy, air quality)
- Floodplain and sea level rise projections
- Wildfire hazard and resilience indices
- Transit and accessibility data

Geospatial analysis and layered mapping techniques are used to identify risk patterns and resilience opportunities.
